											<h2>Maven Analytics Pizza Sales</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The Maven Analytics Pizza Sales project involved cleaning data from a pizza restaurant and querying the data to identify sales trends over the course of a year.<br />
											<br />
											First, the data was cleaned to ensure accuracy during further data analysis. Several of the datasets contained duplicated entries, errors, and formatting inconsistencies.<br />
											<br />
											Data was queried from multiple tables within the Maven's Pizzas database to evalute the store's sales trends over the course of one year. Measures included 
											quantity of orders, quantity of pizzas ordered, revenue, quantity of type of pizzas, and price per order. These measures were used to determine popular days 
											of the week, peak and lull hours, sales per quarter, and most and least popular pizzas. Knowing this information is useful to the stakeholders for making decisions 
											about potential changes to the hours/days of operation and pizza type availability.<br />
											<br />
											Finally, an interactive dashboard was created to present the data to stakeholders and help them make informed decsions about their business.</p>

										<h3>Shark Attacks Throughout History</h3>
										<p>The included dataset contains information about shark attacks all over the world throughout history. This dataset contained many errors and inconsistencies that would make 
											analysis difficult, time consuming, and innaccurate. This project emphasized the use of data cleaning techniques to reorganize and correct errors in the dataset.</p>

										<h3>Pokemon Team Building</h3>
										<p>This project practiced communication with a client (played by my husband) and used data exploration techniques to produce the information requested. SQL was used to build a table of
											Pokemon and their stats and then query the data to fulfill the client requests.<br />
											<br />
											Initially, Microsoft SQL Server was used to create a table of Pokemon and their stats. The SQL script manually created a table and 
											entered all of the data, however this is a tedious and time consuming method of collecting data, especially if new Pokemon need to be added periodically.
											Rather than using SQL, a Python script was used to scrape all of the necessary data from the Pokemon online database, insert it 
											into a dataframe, then create a .csv file to be used in other software.</p>

											<h2>The use of rodent models to better characterize the 
												relationship among epilepsy, sleep, and memory</h2>
										</header>
										<p>With the help of members of the Dr. Teresa Murray lab at Louisiana Tech University and the Dr. Linda Larson-Prior lab 
											at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, I was a co-first author of this literature review which highlights the viability
											and importance of using rodent models to study the roles of sleep in memory and how they are affected by epilepsy. This review 
											was pulbished in Epilepsia in January 2022.</p>

											<h2>Penguin Paramedic<br />
												Senior Design Capstone</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Refrigeration is an easy task to accomplish in a hospital or pharmacy setting; however, not all clinical applications 
											take place in a stationary establishment. Administration of medications in an ambulance saves time and lives. 
											Unfortunately, keeping these medications at the appropriate temperatures of 2-8Â°C in an ambulance poses many challenges, 
											including temperature stability, availability of space, power consumption, heat output, and securability. Penguin Paramedic 
											is a medical refrigeration device that maintains cool medication temperatures in an ambulance for patients receiving pre-hospital 
											care in order to increase the stability of temperature-sensitive medications. The device achieves this outcome by utilizing 
											thermoelectric coolers controlled by a negative feedback loop. These small coolers provide the necessary temperature range for 
											medication storage without expelling large quantities of heat while also minimizing power consumption. Introducing the Penguin Paramedic 
											into ambulances would expand storage capabilities in pre-hospital settings, save time in emergency rooms, and prevent medication waste.<br />
											<br />
											This project included meetings with stakeholders, preparation of a proposal, documentation using a design history file, and several phases of 
											prototyping and benchtop testing. The device was modeled using Solidworks and components were cut using a water jet. In addition to the thermoelectric 
											coolers, fans were also used to disperse the heat generated. The circuit designed to control the thermoelectric coolers and fans included negative feedback 
											loops with cascading switches.</p>

											<h2>The Nanny<br />
												Freshman Smart Device Design</h2>
										</header>
										<p>As a parent or caregiver, bringing young children into a public area can be stressful and overhwleming. A major concern is making sure the child stays close. Whether 
											the concern is getting separated in a busy area, the child's curiosity causing them to wander, or potential kidnapping, caregivers want peace of mind that the child will stay with them.
											All it takes is a few moments for a small child to disappear. Currently, the most common solutions to this problem are holding the child or using a children's harness,commonly refered to as a "child leash".
											Carrying a child while running errands is cumbersome and impractical, especially for those with multiple children. Some people also do not have the physical ability to carry a child.
											A children's harness may also be impractical for many errands, as it still requires a free hand. There is also a stigma towards parents and caregivers who use these devices because, visually, 
											many people see it as putting a child on a dog leash and many parents do not want to experience that judgement.<br />
											<br />
											The Nanny is a smart device alternative to keep the child close. It uses Arduino hardware and software to measure the distance between the parent and child and sets off
											an alarm when a specified distance is exceeded. Essentially, The Nanny behaves as an invisible, auditory leash, keeping the parent or caregiver hands- and judgement-free.</p>

						<!-- About Me -->

									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<span class="logo"><img src="images\Headshot.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p class="content">From 2017 to 2021, I attended Louisiana Tech University to earn my biomedical engineering degree. I also completed minors in mathematics and electrical engineering. 
										Outside of my classes, I helped Dr. Teresa Murray as her lab manager and contributed to the Neuronal Networks in Epilepsy and Memory (NeuroNEM) project. It was during my time with 
										Dr. Murray that I got to start publishing research. Despite no longer attending Louisiana Tech, I have continued to collaborate remotely with Dr. Murray's lab and Dr. Linda Larson-Prior's 
										lab to write and publish our research.<br />
										<br />
										Since graduating, I've decided that a career in data analytics is the path I want to take. In school, I always loved organizing data, especially in Excel, sharing new information I've learned, 
										and solving problems. I am a person who lives their life in spreadsheets and approaches problems as puzzles. My biomedical engineering degree is not as far off from a data analytics career as one 
										may think. My degree taught me many valuable skills including critical thinking, how to analyze experimental data, and the ability to process and relay complex information in a fast-paced environment. 
										To prepare for a career in data analytics, I began teaching myself new skills such as how to use Microsoft SQL Server, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Python. I've also been refining my Microsoft Excel 
										skills. In addition, my ability to independently teach myself the software and coding languages necessary to be a data analyst demonstrates my resourcefulness, intrinsic motivation, and determination to achieve my goals.
										My plan is to integrate all of these skills and experiences to become an effective data analyst.</p>
